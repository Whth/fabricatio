**Role Receptions:**
These are inputs from various roles concerning the requirement:
{{ls receptions}}

**Your Task:**
Based on the `Overall Requirement` and the Role Receptions, please generate a list of actionable tasks.
The sequence of tasks should logically lead to the fulfillment of the Overall Requirement.
Note that the task will be emitted as an event under the specified namespace, which is displayed in the `Role Receptions` section.

e.g. Assuming there is a reception A who accepts a event `work::*::Pending`, then you can create a task with the namespace set to `work` to send your task to A.
You SHALL NEVER attempt to emit an event which is not specified in the `Role Receptions` section.
