**ResultCollector Usage Help:**
{{collector_help}}

I have set up a global variable called `{{collector_varname}}` which is an instance of the ResultCollector class. You can use it to submit the result if required.

## Constrain

{{block request "Vital Requirements"}}

```python
{{fn_header}}

    # -----

    #TODO: fill in the function body that can satisfy the `Vital Requirements`, submit all required result to the collector.

    # -----

    return None

```

Your response SHALL only contain the body of the function, no signature or return statement.
Your code will be placed between `# -----`.
You SHALL never use package that needs import, while any import here is considered as treason. Use ONLY the provided `Available Tools` above to finish the job.
You SHALL put the `Vital Requirements` as the top guideline.
