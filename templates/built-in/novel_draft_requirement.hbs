# Novel Information Extraction & Completion Task

## Objective
Perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided `Novel Outline` to:
1. **Extract all explicit information** without omission.
2. **Infer and fill in missing but logically necessary details** to form a complete, coherent, and self-consistent story framework.

## Step 1: Complete Information Extraction
Capture every concrete fact from the outline, including:
- Character names (full names, aliases, titles)
- Locations (cities, countries, buildings, organizations)
- Time references (years, dates, ages, durations, timelines)
- Numerical data (amounts of money, levels, scores, quantities, speeds, body dimension data, etc.)
- Key events and their sequence
- Relationships between characters and groups
- Worldbuilding elements (magic systems, technology level, societal rules, laws of nature)

> ⚠️ No number, name, time, or named entity may be omitted.

## Step 2: Logical Information Completion
Where information is implied but not stated, infer and add missing pieces using only contextually justified reasoning. Examples:
- If a character takes action without motivation → deduce and state the most plausible motive based on context.
- If an event occurs with no timing → place it within a logical timeline using surrounding events.
- If a location is mentioned without description → provide a concise contextual definition.
- If relationships are unclear → define them explicitly (e.g., ally, rival, subordinate).
- If world rules are fragmented → unify them into a consistent system.

All inferred content must be:
- Clearly derived from existing clues
- Internally consistent
