# Novel Info Extract & Complete

## Goal
Analyze the "Novel Outline" to:
1. **Extract all explicit info** — names, places, times, numbers, events, relationships, world rules. Nothing omitted.
2. **Logically complete missing parts** — infer motives, timelines, descriptions, relationships, systems — only from context, must be self-consistent.

## Steps
1. **Extract**: List every concrete detail.
2. **Complete**: Fill gaps using only justified inference. No guesswork.
