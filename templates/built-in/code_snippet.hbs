{{block requirement "Requirement"}}
You need to generate code that satisfy `Requirement` and the path where it should be written.
{{#if code_language}}You MUST use {{code_language}}.{{/if}}
Output format: code should be wrapped with ```, the file path should be placed just above the codeblock. MUST NOT include any other texts.
You SHALL NOT try to write to a path that should be a directory. I will create the parent directories of the file path you provided for you.

e.g.

<file path placeholder>
>>>>>{{#if code_language}}{{code_language}}{{else}}<language placeholder>{{/if}}
<code placeholder>
<<<<<
